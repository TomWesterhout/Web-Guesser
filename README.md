First contact with the Sinatra framework through The Odin Project: http://www.theodinproject.com/courses/ruby-on-rails/lessons/sinatra-basics
The project aimed at getting familiar with setting up routes and organizing views.

The number guesser game let's the user guess a number between zero and one hundred for a total of five attempts.
If the user hasn't correctly guessed the number in the given five attempts, the game resets and a new random number is chosen.
